                    In humans, glycogen storage diseases result from metabolic inborn errors, and can lead to severe phenotypes 
                    and lethal conditions. Besides these rare diseases, glycogen is also associated to widely spread societal 
                    burdens such as diabetes. Glycogen is a branched glucose polymer synthesised and degraded by a complex set of 
                    enzymes. Over the past 50 years, the structure of glycogen has been intensively investigated. Yet, the interplay 
                    between glycogen structure and the related enzymes is still to be characterised. In this article, we develop a 
                    stochastic coarse-grained and spatially resolved model of branched polymer biosynthesis following a Gillespie algorithm. 
                    Our study largely focusses on the role of the branching enzyme, and first investigates the properties of the model with 
                    generic parameters, before comparing it to in vivo experimental data in mice. It arises that the ratio of glycogen synthase 
                    over branching enzyme activities drastically impacts the structure of the granule. We deeply investigate the mechanism of 
                    branching and parametrise it using distinct lengths. Not only do we consider various possible sets of values for these
                     lengths, but also distinct rules to apply them. We show how combining them finely tunes glycogen macromolecular structure. 
                     Comparing the model with experimental data confirms that we can accurately reproduce glycogen chain length distributions in
                      wild type mice. Additional granule properties obtained for this fit are also in good agreement with typically reported
                       values in the experimental literature. Nonetheless, we find that the mechanism of branching must be more flexible than 
                       usually reported. Overall, we demonstrate that the chain length distribution is an imprint of the branching activity and 
                       mechanism. Our generic model and methods can be applied to any glycogen data set, 
                    and could in particular contribute to characterise the mechanisms responsible for glycogen storage disorders.
