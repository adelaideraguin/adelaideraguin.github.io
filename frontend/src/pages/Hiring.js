                    <p> Dr Adélaïde Raguin and Prof. Zoya Ignatova (University of Hamburg) are seeking to strengthen 
                    their collaboration with a person who holds a Master or equivalent degree in Molecular Life Sciences, 
                    Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Biological Chemistry or equivalent, to pursue a PhD. </p>

                    <p>The project is on the interface of quantitative biology, molecular biology, and computational biophysics
                     to assess crucial questions on how bacteria alter translation to mitigate stress using cell-wide high-throughput 
                     approaches (e.g. RNA-Seq, Ribo-Seq, qPCR, and microarray techniques). During the PhD, you will be developing tailored 
                     experimental approaches to address translation alterations in stress. While you will collect experimental data in the 
                     laboratory of Prof. Ignatova, their analysis will be done applying the innovative approaches from the group of Dr Raguin.
                      You will thereby be embedded in a highly interdisciplinary team of theoreticians and experimentalists, and thus have the
                       unique opportunity to interact with wet lab and computer scientists.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    To apply please send your motivation letter and detailed CV including the names of two persons (who would be willing to 
                    submit references upon request) to:     
                    </p>
