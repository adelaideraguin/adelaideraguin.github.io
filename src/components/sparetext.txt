I am a postdoc at HHU. I recently completed my PhD in computational biophysics at the University of Sheffield, 
                where I also completed my undergraduate degree in Theoretical Physics (MPhys). I am working on a computational project
                at the interface of physics and biology, where we are using stochastic simulations to

                    Impact of drought on the secondary cell wall of poplar xylem, a multi-disciplinary approach.
                    I am working at the interface of computational physics and quantitative biology to model plant 
                    cell wall molecular biosynthesis and water transport at the plant organ scale. We are developing 
                    tailored computational approaches based on advanced stochastic simulations in C++ in order to investigate 
                    the importance of microscopic properties of the xylem on the ability of a species to manage drought 
                    conditions. My project is in collaboration with experimentalist partners at the Research Center
                     of Jülich, and I also engage in the research activities of the interdisciplinary Cluster 
                     of Excellence on Plant Sciences (CEPLAS), which funds the position.
Partho
I am a postdoctoral researcher with a PhD in biophysics. Before joining Dr Raguin's research group, 
                I completed my PhD at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, 
                India. During my PhD, I worked on mathematical and computational modelling of the dynamics at the leading edge 
                of a crawling eukaryotic cell, with a special focus on the emergent 'stick-slip' phenomena. I am 
                working on the development of a computational tool to predict the enzymatic saccharification of 
                lignocellulosic biomass. 
In this project, I am building on the previous computational work of 
                the team to provide free, open-source, and user-friendly software to predict saccharification dynamics 
                for different types of biomass. I run stochastic simulations of the saccharification dynamics of a 
                three-dimensional resolved lignocellulose microfibril (which can vary in structure and composition), 
                that is being digested by a tunable enzyme cocktail. In addition, I utilise experimental data provided 
                by our partners at Forschungszentrum Jülich to calibrate and train the model in order to boost its 
                predictive capability. I believe my work on this project will not only yield a tool to answer precise
                 applied questions (for instance best-adapted enzyme cocktails), but it will also provide new fundamental
                  knowledge on the microscopic mechanisms and kinetics of lignocellulose saccharification.

Merle 
I completed my bachelors degree in quantitative biology at Heinrich Heine University and worked with crops before 
discovering my interest in modelling techniques, which are the focus of my PhD project. Modelling gene expression 
regulation at the whole-translatome scale. I am working on a CEPLAS funded PhD project about modelling gene expression
regulation at the whole-translatome scale under controlled optogenetic perturbation. Translation is a crucial step in
 protein synthesis in all cellular organisms and is hence worth a closer investigation. Various mathematical and computational 
 models are developed for modelling translation in organisms like yeast and bacteria. The aim of this project is to develop the
  first holistic model of translation in plants. To do so, I am using stochastic simulations and a Gillespie algorithm, programmed
   in C++. The dynamic biophysical model will, later on, be expanded and refined with experimental data. The model will aim to answer 
   questions regarding limiting translational resources, stress regulation, ideal ribosomal velocity parameters, codon tuning, or
    translatome-related diseases.

                I did my bachelor's degree at the Institute for applied physics at HHU and I'm currently working on my master's degree.
                Saccharification of cell wall biomass from maize mutants: optimising a fitting algorithm to compare stochastic simulations 
                and quantitative experimental data
                The plant cell walls of crop residues offer a previously unexploited possibility of energy production intended as biofuel. 
                The digestion of the corn cell wall is achieved by various enzymes specialised in saccharification. This process is simulated 
                by a stochastic model in C++. Additionally, a fitting algorithm compares stochastic simulations and quantitative experimental 
                data to find the best-fitting set of input parameters to reproduce the experimental results. I am aiming to optimise the fitting
                 algorithm via two different approaches:  sensitivity analysis to describe the impact each parameter has on saccharification and a
                  new algorithm for an optimised search of the closest fit.

Asma My name is Asma, and I am a master's student in computer science. The focus of my studies is data engineering 
                and model simulations. My bachelor's thesis was about the dynamic motion of swarm robots. It focuses on 
                developing algorithms for self-organization of cooperative robot systems capable of adapting to changing conditions 
                in the environment without having a control-unit. During my studies, I worked as a student assistant in various chairs, 
                mainly as a tutor and proofreader.

                Within the framework of "individual research work", I am currently working on a research project that focuses on the simulation 
                of biological systems. More precisely, we try to mimic the dynamics of motor proteins while crossing the intersection of 
                two microtubules. We opted for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) as our model. TASEP models interacting 
                particles that follow simple rules to move in a one-dimensional environment. Therefore, the focus is on the intersection of two
                 segments and the introduction of pumping-, bias- and detachment- rates on it. The results from the simulations will be compared
                  to the analytical results obtained from the mathematical analysis as well as from the non-linear optimization solvers. By setting 
                  some parameters we can actually control the system to reproduce the same behavior as in biological organisms. In that way, 
                  the model's accuracy can be tested by comparing the simulation results to the existing collected data from biological experiments. 
                  The work can also be expanded to find a model generalization. I.e to look at n intersecting segments instead of two.
